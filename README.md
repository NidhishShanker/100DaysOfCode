# 100DaysOfCode
Hello. everyone! My name is Nidhish Shanker and I am a technical/crypto content writer who is now looking to develop my coding ability. while also gaining a deep understanding of all things Computer Science.

As a technophile, I have a fervent curiosity in multiple fields - my dream of launching my own startups directs me towards android dev/web dev, my fascination with pushing the frontiers of technology attracts me to AI and quantum computing, while my familiarity with Web3 makes me want to become a blockchain developer/auditor. 

Since I already have a job, I have decided to start by building a solid foundation in all these areas, and maybe build some cool, fun projects along the way. Hopefully, this will allow me to gauge what I am passionate about the most and offer me a better sense of purpose. 

Enjoy the journey!
